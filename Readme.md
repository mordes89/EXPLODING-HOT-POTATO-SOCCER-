# [EXPLODING HOT POTATO SOCCER!](https://mordes89.github.io/EXPLODING-HOT-POTATO-SOCCER-/) - Mike Schnall.

Exploding Hot Potato Soccer! is a soccer game played in a rectangular grid with two goals, 
two avatars, a countdown timer, and a hot-potato/ball that explodes.

The objective of the game is to either score a goal by aiming the ball 
into the oponents net, or having the time expire and the ball explode 
on the oponent's side of the field.

## In Exploding Hot Potato Soccer!, users are able to:
1. Kick a ball/hot-potato to the other side trying to score a goal.
2. Bounce the ball off the walls on its way to the oponent's goal.
3. Choose the direction and speed at which to shoot the ball. The ball 
   will stick to the player if the player catches it. Otherwise the ball 
   bounces off all sides of the court.


In addition, this project includes:
- Instructions for the user on their options at each point in the game.
- Fun sounds



### There are two ways to win the game:
1. Score a goal!
2. Time expires with the ball in the opponent's half.



# General
The AI player is an avater that moves around it's own
half chasing the ball.

The player is able to move vertically and horizontally using the arrow 
buttons. When in proximity to the ball, player takes posession, can run with the ball, aim the kick, and kick at a desired velocity. The user cannot hold on to the ball for long, as the avatar will kick the hot-potato away after a while.
There is a random timer that is not known to the user. At time expiration, the ball explodes. The side that the the ball exploded on loses the game.

### Clickable items on the page will include:
 - New game
 - links to my GitHub and Linkedin accounts

# Gameplay
Game controls will be the arrows and a long press on the spacebar to 
determine strength of kick.

There will be an option on the right hand side to choose 
the difficulty level.


This project will use the Canvas API.


# Timeline

- ### Friday:     
            Setup the project,
            Initial research on getting the canvas initialization 
            up and running in the browser. 
            Have a grid in the browser at the least.

- ### Saturday:   
            Get the basic game-board visual in the browser. 
            Start writing the game logic.

- ### Sunday:     
            Research and try to implement the trajectories 
            of the ball element within the baord and gameplay.

- ### Monday:     
            Iron out what I've done so far. Start implementing
            gameplay interactions with the user.
            Start implementing
            gameplay interactions with the AI.
            Refactor code!

- ### Tuesday:    
            Have a presentable simple game. Add functionality 
            and visuals such as funny mocking messages to the user.

- ### Wednesday:  
            Work out any lingering kinks and have a finalized project 
            by end of day.

- ### Thursday:   
            Publish the game on the interwebs!


# Bonus
Hopefully, I will be able to extend the game functionality in the future
with additional features such as dual player mode. Score tallying. Etc.
