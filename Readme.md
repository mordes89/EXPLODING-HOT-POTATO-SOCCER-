# EXPLODING HOT POTATO SOCCER! - Mike Schnall.

Exploding Hot Potato Soccer! is a soccer game played in a rectangular 
grid with two goals, one on each side. 

The objective of the game is to either score a goal by aiming the ball 
into the oponents net, or having the time expire and the ball explode 
on the oponent's side of the field. 



## In Exploding Hot Potato Soccer!, users will be able to:
1. Kick a ball/hot-potato to the other side trying to score a goal.
2. Bounce the ball off the walls on its way to the oponent's goal.
3. Choose the difficulty level to start the game with. This will
   determine the speed at which the AI oponent moves.
4. Choose the direction and speed at which to shoot the ball. The ball 
   will stick to the player if the player catches it. Otherwise the ball 
   bounces off all sides of the court. 
5. Choose an avatar to play with.

In addition, this project will include:
- Instructions for the user on their options at each point in the game.
- Fun remarks mocking the player



### There are two ways to win the game:
1. Score a goal!
2. Get the ball to the other side of the 
   field when the timer expires and the ball explodes!



# General
The AI player will be a board, or an avater "taking-up" 
the space of the board, that will be moving across it's own
goal at a speed determined by the difficulty level chosen (3 speeds).

The player will be able to move vertically with the arrow 
buttons kicking the ball back to the other side. The speed of the 
AI and the speed of the ball will increase as time goes on with 
no goal scored. At time expiration, the ball will explode. The 
side that the the ball exploded on loses the game.

### Clickable items on the page will include:
 - New game
 - links to my GitHub and Linkedin accounts

# Gameplay
Game controls will be the arrows and a long press on the spacebar to 
determine strength of kick.

There will be an option on the right hand side to choose 
the difficulty level.


This project will use the Canvas API.


# Timeline

- ### Friday:     
            Setup the project,
            Initial research on getting the canvas initialization 
            up and running in the browser. 
            Have a grid in the browser at the least.

- ### Saturday:   
            Get the basic game-board visual in the browser. 
            Start writing the game logic.

- ### Sunday:     
            Research and try to implement the trajectories 
            of the ball element within the baord and gameplay.

- ### Monday:     
            Iron out what I've done so far. Start implementing
            gameplay interactions with the user.
            Start implementing
            gameplay interactions with the AI.
            Refactor code!

- ### Tuesday:    
            Have a presentable simple game. Add functionality 
            and visuals such as funny mocking messages to the user.

- ### Wednesday:  
            Work out any lingering kinks and have a finalized project 
            by end of day.

- ### Thursday:   
            Publish the game on the interwebs!


# Bonus
Hopefully, I will be able to extend the game functionality in the future
with additional features such as dual player mode. Score tallying. Etc.
